# A modular synthesizer built in Pure Data

I love modular synthesis. I love Pure Data. Why build yet another modular synth in PD? Because why not!

# How to use this stuff

Each module exists as a PD abstraction. To use a module, create a new PD file and instantiate the abstraction. For instance, if you want to use the `adsr` module, make sure your PD is configured to use the `pd_modular_synth` as a folder for patches and create an object called `adsr`. That should do it!

_I'm not 100% sure how you tell your PD to use the folder.. will add more later once I better understand how that all works_

# The approach

check out `notes.md` for more info about the approach and philosophy. Basically the modular operates using "cv" (audio between -1 and 1).
